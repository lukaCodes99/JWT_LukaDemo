Demos for JWT usage in spring boot 3.x + multiple DB implementation

This repository contains a set of demo application showcasing the usage of JSON Web Tokens (JWT) in a Spring Boot 3.x environment with multiple database implementations.
It also integrates Spring Security to demonstrate secure authentication and authorization processes. Connections with DBs are done via spring data JPA. This demo is designed to understand how to 
implement JWT-based authentication in my Spring Boot project. Added there are some test cases as well.
